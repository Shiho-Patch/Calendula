## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- Month view (S1): Material 3 Expressive card-per-day grid (only the current
  month's weeks; neighbouring days left blank), per-day event dots with "+N"
  overflow, today emphasised via `primaryContainer`, spring-based press
  feedback from the active motion scheme, swipe + drawer navigation,
  Loading/Failure/Success states
- Week view (S2): vertical time schedule with overlap-resolved lanes,
  separate all-day strip, midnight-spanning events clipped per day, swipe
  navigation, Loading/Failure/Success states
- Day view (S3): single-column slice of the week schedule reusing its
  overlap-lane layout, per-day swipe navigation, noon-centred scroll that
  persists across swipes, animated all-day strip, compact top bar with the
  full date, Loading/Failure/Success states
- Functional view-switcher (M1) cycling Month ↔ Week ↔ Day
- Shared calendar UI building blocks in `ui/common/` (navigation drawer,
  failure screen, view-switcher pill, color pastelizer, observable locale)

### Removed
- Throwaway debug screen — superseded by the month view

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-09

### Changed
- Regenerated the F-Droid catalog `icon.png` (512x512, both locales) so it
  is pixel-faithful to the on-device adaptive launcher icon: same slate
  background (`#5C6B7A`), off-white mark (`#FAF6F0`), and the foreground
  group transform (`scale 0.5`, pivot `114,108`, translate `2,8`) baked in.
- Added `design/icon/calendula_launcher.svg` — the composed full-bleed
  icon (background + transformed mark) as the single source of truth for
  store/F-Droid renders.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- Domain models for calendars, event instances, event detail, attendees
- `CalendarContract`-backed `CalendarRepository` with `ContentObserver`-driven live updates
- DataStore preference for app-side hidden-calendar visibility
- `READ_CALENDAR` permission flow (rationale + denied recovery + system-settings shortcut)
- Wegwerfbarer Debug-Screen: zeigt alle Kalender + die nächsten 50 Termine ab heute
- Hilt-Wiring für Data-Layer (Repository, DataSource, DataStore, IO-Dispatcher)
- Unit-Tests für Cursor-Mapping (alle §8-Defensiv-Cases), Repository-Flows mit Turbine, DataStore round-trip
- Instrumented smoke test against the real CalendarContract provider

### Changed
- Redesigned launcher icon: line-art calendar with a stylized "1" inside
  (kalendae reference) and a small calendula bloom badge in the
  bottom-right corner. Replaces the simple "1"-only foreground from
  v0.1.0. Source SVG checked in at `design/icon/calendula_mark.svg`,
  also used to regenerate the F-Droid catalog `icon.png` (512x512)
  per locale.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- F-Droid metadata format: renamed locale dirs from `de/` to `de-DE/`,
  `short_description.txt` to `summary.txt`, `full_description.txt` to
  `description.txt` (fastlane format that fdroidserver actually reads,
  matching the working HouseHoldKeaper convention)
- Added `icon.png` (512x512) per locale; fdroidserver does NOT
  auto-extract icons from APKs that only contain XML adaptive icons
  (which is what minSdk-29 apps produce), so the app was rendered
  blank-iconed in F-Droid clients

### Changed
- CI pipeline cleanup: `lintDebug`/`testDebugUnitTest` instead of full
  `lint`/`test` (cuts ~50% of lint work since release variant lint is
  redundant for V1 single-variant build)
- Release workflow drops the lint step from its CI-sanity job since
  the same lint already ran via `ci.yaml` when the underlying commit
  hit main

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- Initial project scaffold (Gradle Kotlin DSL, Version Catalog, Hilt, DataStore)
- Material 3 Expressive theme with Dynamic Color (API 31+) and slate-derived fallback
- Adaptive launcher icon — stylized "1" on slate squircle (references *kalendae*)
- German + English localization infrastructure
- Permission declaration for `READ_CALENDAR` (no UI flow yet — that's Plan 02)
- Gitea CI workflow: lint, unit tests, debug build, Trivy scan
- Gitea release workflow: signed release APK + F-Droid metadata sync to Hetzner
- F-Droid metadata stubs (DE + EN short/full descriptions)
- `.planning/` project-tracking documents
