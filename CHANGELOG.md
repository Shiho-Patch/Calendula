## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- F-Droid metadata format: renamed locale dirs from `de/` to `de-DE/`,
  `short_description.txt` to `summary.txt`, `full_description.txt` to
  `description.txt` (fastlane format that fdroidserver actually reads,
  matching the working HouseHoldKeaper convention)
- Added `icon.png` (512x512) per locale; fdroidserver does NOT
  auto-extract icons from APKs that only contain XML adaptive icons
  (which is what minSdk-29 apps produce), so the app was rendered
  blank-iconed in F-Droid clients

### Changed
- CI pipeline cleanup: `lintDebug`/`testDebugUnitTest` instead of full
  `lint`/`test` (cuts ~50% of lint work since release variant lint is
  redundant for V1 single-variant build)
- Release workflow drops the lint step from its CI-sanity job since
  the same lint already ran via `ci.yaml` when the underlying commit
  hit main

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- Initial project scaffold (Gradle Kotlin DSL, Version Catalog, Hilt, DataStore)
- Material 3 Expressive theme with Dynamic Color (API 31+) and slate-derived fallback
- Adaptive launcher icon — stylized "1" on slate squircle (references *kalendae*)
- German + English localization infrastructure
- Permission declaration for `READ_CALENDAR` (no UI flow yet — that's Plan 02)
- Gitea CI workflow: lint, unit tests, debug build, Trivy scan
- Gitea release workflow: signed release APK + F-Droid metadata sync to Hetzner
- F-Droid metadata stubs (DE + EN short/full descriptions)
- `.planning/` project-tracking documents
