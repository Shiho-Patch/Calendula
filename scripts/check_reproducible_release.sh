# Reproducibility guard for the official F-Droid repo (de.jeanlucmakiola.calendula).
#
# F-Droid only republishes OUR signed binary if a from-source build reproduces it
# byte-for-byte and the binary carries no extra signing blocks. If any invariant
# below regresses, the official repo silently stalls on the last good version
# (fails safe — but you'd be stuck on an old release without noticing). So fail
# loudly here, on every PR.
#
# Each invariant was learned from a real fdroiddata CI rejection (see
# docs/fdroid-official/ and the v2.7.3 -> v2.7.5 history):
#   1. vcsInfo { include = false }          — else AGP embeds env-dependent git
#      metadata (META-INF/version-control-info.textproto) -> not reproducible.
#   2. no foojay toolchain resolver         — F-Droid's offline source scanner
#      rejects org.gradle.toolchains.foojay-resolver (it can fetch a JDK over
#      the network at build time).
#   3. dependenciesInfo { includeInApk = false } — else AGP embeds a "Dependency
#      metadata" block (id 0x504b4453) in the APK Signing Block, which F-Droid's
#      binary scanner rejects as an extra signing block.
